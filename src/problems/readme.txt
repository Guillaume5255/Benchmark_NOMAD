here are the files containing the problems. 
blackbox.cpp and blackbox.hpp are the libaries for the 24 analytical problems and STYRENE.

We use startingPointStyrene.cpp to generate differents starting points for the STYRENE problem in order to get several instances of it. this generates the file STYRENE/points/startingPointsMinDist20.txt. 20 is the minimal euclidian distance between the starting points generated, can be set in the file.
